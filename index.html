        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Mynor Aguirre" width="200">
        <p>I'm 32 years old, and my family, including my two daughters and two dogs, is the focus of my life. Outside of
            work, I
            enjoy playing football (soccer), engaging in mountain biking (MTB), and spending quality time with my family
            through
            various activities. I also have a passion for cooking. I am genuinely enthusiastic and look forward to
            learning as much
            as possible about programming.</p>
